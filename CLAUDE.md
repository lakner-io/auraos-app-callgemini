## What is AuraOS, in one screen

AuraOS is a browser-based WebOS that runs inside one Docker container.
There are two layers:

1. **The shell** (`packages/shell`, listens on `:3000`) — an Astro SSR app
   that draws the desktop: status bar, dock, launcher, layout manager, process
   manager. It owns the `AppManager` (lifecycle FSM, port allocator), the
   reverse proxy at `/api/proxy/<id>/<path>`, the content-provider router at
   `/api/data/<authority>/<path>`, and a global SSE event bus.

2. **The apps** (`apps/<reverse.domain.id>/`) — each is its **own Astro app**
   spawned in a **PRoot sandbox** with `/workspace`, `/data`, and an opt-in
   set of toolchain binaries bind-mounted in. Apps never talk to the browser
   directly; the shell proxies every request and injects HTML rewrites + a
   console-relay script into each iframe.

The shell loads each running instance in an iframe pointing at
`/api/proxy/<instanceId>/`. The proxy forwards to `http://localhost:<port>`
where the app's Astro dev server listens.

## What an "Aura app" is

It's an Astro app with `app.manifest.json` and lifecycle HTTP endpoints under
`src/pages/api/lifecycle/`. The shell calls those endpoints over HTTP when
it spawns, pauses, resumes, or kills your instance.

You **don't need to ship `entrypoint.sh` or `health.ts`** — `ProotRunner`
synthesises the entrypoint, and `auraAppIntegration()` (in `astro.config.mjs`)
injects `/api/lifecycle/health`. Both can still be overridden by shipping
your own file if you really need to.

### Required surface

| Path                                          | Purpose                                                                |
|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `app.manifest.json`                           | Identity, modes, tools, permissions, viewConfig, optional dataProvider |
| `astro.config.mjs`                            | Must include `auraAppIntegration()`                                    |
| `src/pages/api/lifecycle/onCreate.ts`         | `POST` — first hook after spawn                                        |
| `src/pages/api/lifecycle/onStart.ts`          | `POST` — after `onCreate`                                              |
| `src/pages/api/lifecycle/onResume.ts`         | `POST` — every time the instance becomes the foreground                |
| `src/pages/api/lifecycle/onPause.ts`          | `POST` — when the user backgrounds the app                             |
| `src/pages/api/lifecycle/onStop.ts`           | `POST` — before destroy                                                |
| `src/pages/api/lifecycle/onDestroy.ts`        | `POST` — final shutdown hook                                           |
| `src/pages/api/lifecycle/onActivityCreate.ts` | (Optional) `POST` returning `{ path, title? }` for activity apps       |

The scaffold ships every required hook as a one-liner that uses
`createLifecycleHandler()` from `@aura/app-sdk`. Add your own behaviour by
passing an `impl`:

```ts
// src/pages/api/lifecycle/onDestroy.ts
import { createLifecycleHandler } from '@aura/app-sdk';
import { state } from '../../../state.js';
export const POST = createLifecycleHandler('onDestroy', async () => {
  state.activities.clear();
  await flushPendingWrites();
});
```

For activity-mode apps, use the typed activity factories:

```ts
// src/pages/api/lifecycle/onActivityCreate.ts
import { createActivityCreateHandler } from '@aura/app-sdk';
import { state } from '../../../state.js';
export const POST = createActivityCreateHandler(({ activityId }) => {
  state.activities.add(activityId);
  return { path: '/', title: `My App ${activityId.split('#').pop()}` };
});
```

```ts
// src/pages/api/lifecycle/onActivityDestroy/[activityId].ts
import { createActivityDestroyHandler } from '@aura/app-sdk';
import { state } from '../../../../state.js';
export const POST = createActivityDestroyHandler((activityId) => {
  state.activities.delete(activityId);
});
```

## Manifest fields

The scaffold writes only the fields you actually need to pick — every other
manifest field has a sensible schema default. Run `aura dev clean-manifest`
to strip any default-valued fields you've written by hand.

```jsonc
{
  "id": "com.example.foo",         // reverse-domain; equals dir name
  "name": "Foo",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "description": "...",
  "category": "utility",            // also: productivity, media, communication, system, game, developer
  "permissions": [],                // see Permission strings below
  "tools": ["bash", "node"],        // bind-mounted from /os/toolchain/bin/
  "instanceMode": "single",         // 'single' | 'multi'
  "activityMode": "none"            // 'none' | 'multi'
}
```

Optional fields (all have defaults — only set them if you need a non-default):
`maxInstances`, `maxActivitiesPerInstance`, `defaultLaunch`,
`backgroundService`, `warmPool`, `viewConfig`, `preferredLayout`,
`themeStrategy`, `theme`, `keymapActions`, `dataProvider`, `serverPort`,
`icon`, `entrypoint`.

**Instance vs. Activity**:
- *Instance* = one running backend process (one Astro server, one PID, one port).
- *Activity* = one UI screen / iframe. Multiple activities can share an instance.
- Single-instance apps reuse the same backend; activity-mode apps get multiple
  views in the layout, each with its own `activityId` in the URL.

## Theming (`themeStrategy`)

AuraOS exposes its palette as CSS custom properties (`--aura-color-primary`,
`--aura-color-bg`, …) plus a `prefers-color-scheme`-aware light/dark axis.
Pick how this app participates by setting `themeStrategy` in the manifest:

| Strategy    | What the proxy injects                                    | When to use                                     |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `inherit`   | `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/api/os/theme.css">` + meta | **Default.** Use `var(--aura-color-*)` and you're done. |
| `themed`    | `<meta name="aura-theme-id">`, `aura-color-mode`, framework | App ships its own palettes but reacts to OS theme/mode (via `osClient.onThemeChange()` / `onModeChange()`). |
| `override`  | Only `aura-color-mode` meta as a hint                     | App owns its palette completely — photo editors, brand-locked surfaces, accessibility tools. |

The Process Manager surfaces a `THEMED` / `OVERRIDE` chip on apps that don't
`inherit`, so users understand why an app looks different.

For most apps, leave it at `inherit` and just reference the CSS vars:

```css
body { background: var(--aura-color-bg); color: var(--aura-color-text); }
.primary { color: var(--aura-color-primary); }
```

## Styling rules that stop silent misses

CSS that doesn't apply never errors — the element just falls back to the
browser's default chrome, which still *looks* like a deliberate design. Four
rules keep that from happening:

**1. Style by class, select by `data-*`.** A class on an element must exist
because it carries styling. When JS needs to find an element, give it a data
attribute, not a second class — a JS-only class has no rule behind it, and the
day someone reuses it for a new control it renders unstyled.

```html
<!-- WRONG: .row-del-vol is a JS hook with no rule; it renders as a UA button -->
<button class="row-del-vol" data-name="shared">DELETE</button>

<!-- RIGHT: one styled class, the hook lives in the data attribute -->
<button class="row-del" data-vol="shared">DELETE</button>
```

```js
tbody.addEventListener('click', (e) => {          // delegate, don't rebind
  const btn = e.target.closest('.row-del[data-vol]');
  if (btn) removeVolume(btn.dataset.vol);
});
```

Delegation matters for the same reason: re-rendering rows drops per-button
listeners, and rebinding after a partial update stacks a second listener on
the rows that survived.

**2. Rows built with `innerHTML` need `<style is:global>`.** Astro scopes a
plain `<style>` by stamping `data-astro-cid-*` on the markup it renders. HTML
you inject at runtime never gets that attribute, so scoped rules stop matching
the moment a row is re-rendered. Either render those elements with `is:global`
styles (say why in a comment) or keep the whole list server-rendered.

**3. Tailwind only sees files it scans.** Utilities used inside a package
outside your app's scan roots (e.g. `@aura/ui` components) are dropped from
the build unless that path is declared with `@source`. When a utility class
does nothing, check the scan roots before debugging the markup.

**4. Theme tokens are a closed set.** `/api/os/theme.css` defines exactly
`--aura-color-{primary,secondary,danger,info,warning,success,bg,surface,surface-2,text,text-dim,border}`
and `--aura-glow-{primary,secondary,danger,subtle}`. Any other name is not an
error — `var(--aura-color-bg-elev, #111)` silently uses the literal, so an
invented token looks correct under dark themes and renders black under light
ones. Don't give these vars literal fallbacks either: if the token exists the
fallback is dead code, and if it doesn't you want to see that. For a filled
control, `background: var(--aura-color-primary); color: var(--aura-color-bg)`
keeps the label legible in both modes.

When something looks unstyled, confirm it with computed style rather than by
eye — `getComputedStyle(el).borderTopStyle === 'outset'` is the tell for a
button that got no rule at all.

## Runtime context the app sees

Inside the PRoot, your Astro process gets:

| Env var               | Meaning                                                              |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `APP_ID`              | Manifest `id`                                                        |
| `APP_INSTANCE_ID`     | `appId` (single) or `appId-N` (multi)                                |
| `APP_PORT`            | The port to bind your Astro server to                                |
| `OS_API_BASE`         | Shell URL — usually `http://localhost:3000`                          |
| `AURA_LAYER_TAG`      | "[proot+ctnr]" — for prompts / diagnostics                           |

Don't reach for `process.env` directly — use the SDK's `getAppContext()`:

```ts
import { getAppContext } from '@aura/app-sdk';
const ctx = getAppContext();
// → { appId, instanceId, appPort, osApiBase, dataDir, layerTag }
```

On HTTP requests proxied through the shell, your handlers also receive:

| Request header        | Meaning                                                              |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `x-aura-app-id`       | Your app id                                                          |
| `x-aura-instance-id`  | The instance id                                                      |
| `x-aura-activity-id`  | The current activity id (only present for activity-mode apps)        |

Read them via `readIdentityHeaders(request)` from the SDK rather than
hand-rolling `request.headers.get(...)`.

## Common patterns

**Live updates to the iframe**: open an SSE endpoint inside your app
(`src/pages/api/events.ts`) and connect from the browser with
`new EventSource('api/events')` — relative URL, because the iframe's
`<base href>` is set by the proxy. The shell preserves stream lifetimes.

**WebSockets**: add an integration in `astro.config.mjs` that hooks
`astro:server:setup` and listens for `upgrade` events on `server.httpServer`.
The shell's Vite plugin proxies the upgrade through
`ws://<host>/api/proxy/<id>/<path>`. See `apps/com.aura.terminal` for a
working example (PTY over `/ws`) and `apps/com.aura.console` for a logging
WebSocket that persists to disk.

**Cross-app data**: declare a `dataProvider` in the manifest and serve
`/api/data/<...>` from your app. Other apps reach you via
`/api/data/<authority>/<your-path>` on the shell; permissions are checked
by the `PermissionManager`. Read provider data with `OsClient` from
`@aura/app-sdk` (`queryProvider`, `writeProvider`, `watchProvider`) or
plain `fetch`.

**Console + debugging**: every iframe's `console.*`, uncaught errors,
unhandled rejections, `fetch`/`XHR`/`EventSource` errors are auto-relayed
to the shell and forwarded to the Console app (and persisted to a JSONL
file via WebSocket → `apps/com.aura.console`). No setup needed.

**Keyboard shortcuts + OS Back + system actions**: all flow through the
single `@aura/app-sdk` framework. Declare actions in the manifest, register
handlers via `osClient.keymap.on(...)`, intercept Back via
`osClient.nav.onBack(...)`, trigger OS actions via `osClient.system.*`.
Apps that integrate nothing keep every native browser keyboard behavior
(text inputs, IME, Tab focus, Ctrl+A/C/Z, etc.) — the OS only intercepts
combos that are explicitly claimed.

```jsonc
// app.manifest.json
{
  "keymapActions": [
    { "id": "save", "label": "Save",  "category": "File", "defaultCombo": "Ctrl+s" },
    { "id": "find", "label": "Find",  "category": "Edit", "defaultCombo": "Ctrl+f" }
  ]
}
```

```ts
// in your page or React island
import { OsClient } from '@aura/app-sdk';
const osClient = new OsClient();

osClient.keymap.on('save', () => saveDocument());
osClient.keymap.on('find', () => openFindDialog());

osClient.nav.onBack((e) => {
  if (unsavedChanges()) { e.preventDefault(); confirmDiscard(); }
});

// Read the user's current mapping for menu shortcut hints — refreshed live.
const saveCombo = osClient.keymap.getBinding('save');  // "Ctrl+KeyS" or null

osClient.system.openLauncher();          // programmatic OS actions
osClient.system.switchWorkspace(2);
```

Combos accept friendly shorthand (`Ctrl+s` ⇄ `Ctrl+KeyS`). The user can
remap any action in **Settings → Keyboard**; your handler keeps firing
under the new combo without code changes. Action ids are namespaced
`app.<appId>.<short>` automatically — pass either the short id (`save`) or
the fully qualified id; the SDK handles both.

## CLI cheatsheet

```sh
# from inside the container or any shell with `aura` on PATH:
aura app start    com.example.foo
aura ps                                  # who's running
aura inst shell   com.example.foo[-N]    # drop into the PRoot
aura inst logs    com.example.foo[-N]    # tail logs
aura cap install  <name>                 # add a tool to /os/toolchain/bin/
aura cap grant    com.example.foo <cap>  # add to this manifest's tools[]
aura dev validate apps/com.example.foo   # schema-check the manifest
aura dev clean-manifest <path>           # strip default-valued fields
aura events       --filter "app:*"       # watch the event bus
aura whereami                            # what layer am I in (proot/ctnr/host)
```

The terminal apps' bash also annotates the prompt with the detected layer
(`root@<host>[proot+ctnr]:~$`) via a snippet in `/root/.bashrc`.

## Project conventions

- TypeScript strict, ES modules.
- Reverse-domain IDs (`com.example.foo`); the dir name must equal `manifest.id`.
- Don't import server-only Node modules into client-rendered Astro pages.
- HMR is disabled in app iframes (the upstream Vite WS isn't reachable from
  the browser through the proxy). Full iframe reload picks up changes.
- Class names are for styling, `data-*` attributes are for JS hooks — see
  "Styling rules that stop silent misses".
- After a write, render the row from the response you already have; treat the
  follow-up list GET as reconciliation, and never swallow its failure with a
  bare `if (!res.ok) return`.
- Apps cannot mutate state in `/os/` or the shell — only `/data` is writable
  per-instance. Use a content provider if you need to expose state to others.
- PRoot is a filesystem sandbox, not a security sandbox: it shares the host
  kernel and has no UTS / PID / user namespace. Treat apps as cooperating,
  not adversarial.

## Where things live in the parent repo

```
packages/core         AppManager, ProotRunner, OsEventBus, PermissionManager,
                      ContentProviderRegistry, ThemeManager, manifest schema
packages/shell        Astro SSR shell, /api/proxy, /api/data, /api/apps,
                      OSLayout (console bridge, theme), launcher, layout
packages/app-sdk      App-side SDK: OsClient, lifecycle factories, context,
                      auraAppIntegration
packages/aura-cli     The `aura` CLI you just used to scaffold this app
packages/ui           Shared UI primitives
apps/<id>             Each app, including this one
```

## Where to look when stuck

- Lifecycle FSM and allowed transitions: `packages/core/src/app-manager/LifecycleStateMachine.ts`
- How the shell builds your iframe URL: `packages/shell/src/pages/index.astro` (`buildView`)
- How HTML/JS get rewritten on the way to the iframe: `packages/shell/src/pages/api/proxy/[id]/[...path].ts`
- How the spawner constructs the PRoot args: `packages/core/src/app-manager/ProotRunner.ts` (`buildProotArgs`)
- The reference apps for richer patterns: `apps/com.aura.terminal` (WS+PTY),
  `apps/com.aura.notepad` (multi-activity shared state), `apps/com.aura.counter`
  (multi-instance + activities), `apps/com.aura.settings` (content provider + theme),
  `apps/com.aura.console` (WS persistence + static HTML page).
